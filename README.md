# Un mot français

[*Un mot français*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/un-mot-fran%C3%A7ais/ajohfegeceikkpapkegoammmaogfmbld) is an open-source Chrome Extension with a simple goal --> to help people learning French/English to improve their vocabulary, one new browser tab at a time.

I'd be thrilled to have contributions from anyone interested in the project :D
